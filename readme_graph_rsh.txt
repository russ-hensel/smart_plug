======================= Status ========================


Runs but largely not working .... gui appears but lots of bogus stuff



======================= to do =======================


** create empty db
** export csv

!! initial db file name needs to be full path if it is not in the parameter file

!! add device name to graph
** add save graph ( on window )
** units and zero
!! make several devices on seperate graphs


for time see parameters.py

right now ( maybe ) unit conversion is supported only for the time axis
units that are available ( parameters.py   )




====================== Notes ==========================

adding DateEntry to the gui, pip instlled


======================History To Do ================================
** = when done   !! = planned or considerd ?? = think about

!! live graph -- research

       self.starting_dir   = os.getcwd()

========================= Dead Code ========================================================
