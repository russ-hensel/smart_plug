Purpose: This is a Graphical User Interface Application is to control TP-LINK HS110 Smart Plug w/Energy Monitoring (*TP-LINK HS110 Smart Plug w/Energy Monitoring - - Amazon.com ) graph and otherwise process the data. The application uses the pyHS100 library code.

Enviroment: Program should run on any OS supporting Python 3.6.  This should include Windows, Mac, Linux, and Raspberry Pi.  So far only tested on Windows.  More coming... 

Program Status: More or less alpha/beta, seems to work, but rough. Intended for those with some Python experience who can add the files to their Python development environment ( no install features for this code ). Some dependencies will need to be installed, probably prompted by error messages. Editing of the parameter file should be easier for those with Python experience. Users should find some useful documentation in the code, this is still a work in progress. Much code has been lifted from other projects of mine, some artifacts remain.
